pliant is the bamboo;
i am man of earth.
they say that from the bamboo
we had our first birth.
am i of the body,
or of the green leaf?
do i have to whisper
my every sin and grief?
if the wind passes by,
must i stoop, and try
to measure fully
my flexibility?
i might have been the bamboo,
but i will be a man,
bend me then, o lord,
bend me if you can.

the land was a black dream
of ruby
on the navel of the earth.
we built our homes on her belly,
we tilled there our desires.
but we could not find the ruby
on the navel of the earth,
we could not make the ruby
in to the stone of a ring.
the land of our visions loomed
a rich, vast land for us,
but strange hordes came after us
and drove us all away!

the coconuts have ripened,
they are like nipples to the tree.
	(a woman has only two nipples,
	there are many women lives in a coconut tree.)
soon the coconut will grow heavy and fall,
i shall pick up one&many&
	like a child i shall suck out their milk,
	i shall suck out of coconuts little white songs;
	i shall be reminded of many women.
i shall kiss a coconut because it is the nipple
	of a woman.

the country that is my country
is not of this hemisphere, nor of any
other; is neither west nor east:
nor is it on the north or south:
	i reject the littleness of the compass.
is not the philippines:
nor america: nor spain nor `ungary:
nor is it any other country.
	i disclaim
nations, tribes, peoples, flags:
i disclaim the filipino,
the american, the yugoslavian,
the swede -- all separations,
divisions, distinctions.
	i disclaim
the countryman, the patriot,
the talker of countries.
	i claim the fellowman:
	the human being: the man
only thus do i claim you:
only thus can i belong to you:
and only thus can you belong to me.
go from me, you patriots:
go from me who would have me babble
of love for my nation!
	i have no such love:
	i am the patriot of no country:
	i patriotise no nation --
	i patriotise man, the human being.
the country that is my country
is in no geography:
is in no mouth:
	is in the heart.
the country that is my country
	is earth: its men.
	is sky: the love within their hearts.
	is the sky beyond the sky: the one.

when love has blinded me
and thrown me against a tree
and rent my soul with woe,
out of the dark a voice spoke low:
"lover: be not afraid:this
is but the way of love: for her kiss
much must the real lover weep:
aye, her kiss wounds deep."
when it had spoken, i said:
"alas, o life, love has made
thee into night: nor moon nor star
nor god nor the young flower
can illuminate me now&"
and then methought: "but voice, who art thou?"
and quietly the voice answered me:
"i -- i loved, and hung upon a tree."

there are roads that lead to the city,
there are white roads, hard, without pity;
	there are dim highways, wending
to the darksome realm of the fates;
	and a fairy road, ending
where my true-love, soft-eyed, waits.

i face the east -- i watch the painter, morn,
	take up his brush of golden rays, and stain
with rosy hue the skies. i whisper, lorn&
	on such a dawn she has left, and oh, the pain!

you ask me what it is. it is the thunder
of singing centuries; the fallen gleam
from minds immortal that with breathless wonder
strode woodpaths, faery-foliaged, of the dream;
	as ancient as the stars, and yet as young
	as this dawn's rose, or thrill of bells just rung.

sweet friend of muses, pensive cigarette!
	soothing with soft and velvet-vaporous breath
	the soul of poet, while he fashioneth
his gentle rhymes! who overcome the fret
of restless troubling pain, and dim regret,
	and lends man peace to brood of life and death,
	till flow in stately calmness all he saith --
while round him listless fumes of eddying yet.
but if he wish to strke more stirring song,
	leaping in warlike numbers, fierce and fleet,
thou, cigarette, remain his stout friend still,
	responsive, glowing red with passionate heat,
to his heart's furious throbbings, while the strong
	and volumed smoke obeys his martial will.

i have always loved the morning rise in gold beyond the bay,
	o'er the mountains and the dark-blue sea;
see her fling her tinted mantle round her shoulders, while the gray
of the night-time melts like dreamings and the pale stars fly away,
while her sunlight-trumpets sweetly sing the coming of the day
to the waking cliff that whitens, with the brightening of the spray,
	on the blueness as the waves surge free.

tomorrow? -- it matters not
what it may hold for me.
and yesterday? -- i have forgot --
it is enough to be.

this door of fire
betwixt me and my soul's desire --
this thing that i may break with sullen fist
yet face again unbroken to resist
my eager rush on futile steed
with only my seared hand to witness to the deed -- 
this chain impalpable that breaks
yet with the clanking of its breaking and the aches
scarce dulled, i find again its links hard upon my wrist,
paying out so far, no further, to where i may, not where i list --
this secret word
that schedules venus, spins the stars,
nor lets saturn crash on mars,
this dyke upon which breaks my desire
like a wave of fire,
nor filters one red drop through --
this armament that sheilds me true
yet bruses my felicity with tough unyielding leather --
this gentle tether--
this imponderable juggernaut whose wheels
crush the devotee while the prayer heals --
this damned chameleon whose fickle hide
changes with the land, the age,
the circumstance of power, pomp, and personage,
yet whose principles and presences abide --
this tall, incurious gaoler, alive and dead,
armed with abstractions, shod with lead,
eyed with empty sockets that are stars,
who harries yet protects me, and behind whose bars
i fume and fret and loud have wept
knowing not i am well-kept --
this dragon of impartial maw,
this shield that cuts me raw,
this relentless shadow that beds between me and my love,
this door, this light, these wings above,
this word, this armament, this angel, dyke,
juggernaut, chameleon, gaoler, tyke,
this gain and loss,
this serpent on a cross --
this law.

i saw the bird
with gorgeous plumes --
i heard its mating call:
it sounded loudly through the glen,
beneath the noisy waterfall.
it spread its wings proudly in the light --
alas, how soon it would be night!

my tiredness crawls like a spider
upon my restless brain;
it weaves a net to catch the fever
of my weakness and pain.
its hairy limbs walk on my head,
its clumsy fingers run through my hair --
it's thinking i am dead.

i am a juggler
of hazardous moments.
my oranges are real oranges,
and i eat them all
when my show is over.
my daggers -- ah,
one of them pricked the heart of
my antonietta.

the japanese girl stood behind the counter
grinding ice. it was not so in osaka.
nor beneat the shadow of fujiyama.
there it was autumn winter spring summer -- 
with lotus and cherry trees, and a handsome lover
catching dragonflies along the wall, the dew
of strong emotion beneath his kimono, too,
though frogs become chorus for the river&
but i rashly turned to the japanese girl and said:
"i'll have iced milk and one napoleon, please."
and switched away from the counter with ease.
"only milk and napoleon?" she asked. and dead
became the lotus stems of osaka now. only
iced milk and napoleon for me.

	dear lord:
let thou be the street-cleaner
whilst i be the road.

huge slow ponderous ships of may,
white-hulled, laden with dreams, brimming
	with skiey gleams;
long lean cruisers in war array,
black-hulled, laden with ire, anchored
	with prongs of fire.

my eyes have seen the tombs of ming
beyond the walls of old peking,
and i have heard muscovy sing,
	in the movies.
i've sailed the blue tyrrhenian sea,
have had my fling in gay paree,
a russian prince has danced for me,
	in the movies.
i've lost my way in london fogs,
won dizzy sums on racing dogs,
watched chicago kill her hogs,
	in the movies.
you're sad because you're poor -- but why?
when a million more is spent to try
to make you laugh, or glow, or cry,
	in the movies.
then cease to fret for fame or gain,
for you can meet the king of spain,
or ride across the ganges plain,
	in the movies!

lo! here we are at last!
	up on love's hill,
our lips, our spirits fast --
	drinking of each our fill.
drinking and wondering:
	is this the peak?
heaven throbs close, impending -- 
	o sweet! let us not speak!

so this is the fruit: the singing entry
lip on lip into a rising heaven;
this wildfire sweetness surging fierce-driven
to a keen flamed peak; this pollen glory
raining coll through muted joy; and this deep
clear wonder waking to a smile, as high!
song floods in me; my heart leaps sky from sky --
how easily! heaven clings to my lip!
i dare you touch my hand without a tree
bursting within me into coutless bloom,
each exquisite with individual fire!
whence this accumulated ecstasy,
this million-buddd cry through foliaged gloom
to sun with every pulse of your desire?

	the waking east
		flowers in light,
	the darksome west
		speeds its flight,
and o'er the sky the waning stars are slain
by day's bright shafts that shoot in golden rain.
	a bugle calls
		as people wake;
	within the walls
		the soldiers break
their sleep, while nearer draw the shades of grief
to take a life from joy and love so brief.
	and now must one
		within a cell
	to a field be gone
		to bid farewell
to all this shining, glorious world of dreams,
while freely flow dark sorrow's crystal streams.
	the martyr walks
		familiar ways,
	past sad kinfolks
		and bygone days
of soaring hours come like a myriad lights
to bear him through the distant, unknown heights.
	farewell, pure heart,
		exalted soul!
	so high thy part
		and dizzy goal --
farewell, o dazzling star! o pillar strong!
how lone thy spirit in all this alien throng!
	the sign is given --
		the field is won!
	now mark, just heaven,
		this bleeding son!
in vain, mother spain, these vivas smite the skies;
from this red field a ghost of doom shall rise.

the pendulum
is a thing of dread
to nervous persons like me.
it reminds one of swaying iscariot -- 
suspended from a tree.

i sometimes think
that -- when men die --
they acquire a sense of humor.
else, why do their skulls
seem to grin with merriment?
theirs is the silent and superior laugh
of those who enjoy a secret joke.

there is a flower strange i fear that smells
of fragrance smothered with remembered tears;
there is a voice whose soundless echo dwells
persistent humming a name within my ears;
there is a song that swells with sweet refrain,
that drifts with silence from the depths of night
so brief and dreamy with a kind delight --
you come to me when you have ceased to call,
have ceased to feel the glow within my eyes:
you come -- alas! -- a phantom to appall
my thoughts of you who don a stranger's guise.
	 i fear myself, my shadow on the wall&
	 my love, in death you have not ceased to call!

a multitude
of upraised arms,
shadowed black against the sky:
soul of my country,
lifting its cry.

another day is over, lord,
	i give it now to thee,
and let it be a golden bead
	on my life's rosary.

i find his kingdom in the shrine
where praying voices ring;
i hear the music of his voice
when merry children sing.
i feel his presence in the air,
his touch when cool winds pass;
i see his image in the stream,
his footprints on the grass!

i am intimate with god.
i befriended him&
one day twenty years ago
when he came fire-robed
from the burning sunset.
he came to play with me
under the twilight shadows
of century-old ilang-ilang trees.
falling from the indigo skies
he was like a white plume
shed from a heron's warm breast.
oftentimes i have come upon god
in unexpected places:
i saw him in the smile
of my dead nephew
who was barely through with his twelve months.
i saw him within the ebon depths
of an ilonga's eyes
on the eye of my departure for the states.
he is the penitent sighing
pricked by the million needles of the pine.
when emilia teresa
goes away to be a queen of somebody's heart,
i will go as i have promised him
to live forever in his house
on the top of the hill.

the night, the night, o the fairy night!
	the languid moon above!
o the smiling heavens calm and bright,
	and the throbbing songs of love!
the night, the night, o the tropic night!
	the waters murmuring low!
o the haunting sad and sweet delight
	of thoughts of long ago!

the cry awoke balintawak,
and the echoes answered back --
	"freedom!"
all the four winds listened long
to the shrieking of that song --
	"freedom!"
in all the fields of rice and can
shook the stalks with that refrain --
	"freedom!"
i heard it from the planters in the vales, --
i heard it from the traders tying bales, --
i heard it where the fishers strike their sails, --
	"freedom!"
all the poets struck their lyre
with those burning notes of fire --
	"freedom!"
all the women knelt to pray
in their hearts that frenzied lay --
	"freedom!"
e'en the children and the old
took to arms and shouted bold --
	"freedom!"
i heard it from the huskers 'neath the trees, --
i heard it from the divers of the seas, --
i heard it from the pounders in the leas, --
	"freedom!"
all the people raised the cry,
fearing not to bleed or die --
	"freedom!"
all the tombs of slave and sire
broke to voice that great desire --
	"freedom!"
up the mountain, down the plain,
louder, louder, rang the strain --
	"freedom!"
i heard it from the makers of the brooms, --
i heard it from the weavers at their looms, --
i heard it in the smoking smithy rooms, --
	"freedom!"
from the temples, from the shrines,
from the bosom of the mines --
	"freedom!"
kris and bolo flashed in light,
thunder-voices air did smite --
	"freedom!"
muscles stout and spirit strong,
broke the chain with metal song --
	"freedom!"
i heard it in the bullets' whine and roar, --
i heard it in the farthest island shore, --
i heard it and shall hear it ever more, --
	"freedom!"

life, throbbing in the veins beneath the gnarled bark
of spreading branches, gaunt and bare, in some forgotten park,
broke forth in glorious flame, and set each waiting tree afire,
a crimson revelry of passion, of flaunting bright desire;
life fiercely kissed their tips -- they bloomed a myriad burning suns,
and all the park was like a marne ablaze with fire of guns!
they shed red petals on the ground, as red as human blood,
and carpeted the sleeping grass with ardent passion flood,
that even the heavens borrowed hues of vivid tones of flame,
and thinking this a battleground, blushed a blush of shame.
but there's a fatal day when all this splendor fades away
and not a trace of left of that exulting red array,
when all the radiant grandeur of this splendid crimson scene
descends into monotony of common bottle green&
o god, dear god! i beg of you to spare that i should see
the day when petals flutter down my life's ensanguined tree!

i asked whether you had love for me -- 
	you smiled and sweetly said,
"look deep into my eyes and see
	what's to be read."
i looked into your eyes and saw
	my eyes within your eyes,
and there the bright reflected glow
	of mine own lies.

cool, drowsy evenings are with us again --
cool, drowsy evenings, stars, and a clear moon:
this is the time i must be waiting, then,
for you, beloved, with a quiet tune
upon my lips which is your loved name.
come forth: and watch with me the bats at play,
circling the void in their amorous game;
the moon is caught within a blossomy spray.
o do not tarry. soft the moonlight sleeps
upon the slivered leafles steeped with dew,
and all night long the water shoreward creeps,
as my soul reaches longingly for you&
come out, sweet one, the night is waning low,
my heart is aching, and i want you so!

you would conquer the heavens
with towering scrapers,
and threatening spires,
with steeples that fiercely gleam&
	but your skies seem even more foreign to you,
	and far.
we,
worshipful,
wrapped in naive wonderment,
look humbly to the skies -- as a slave to his king --
	and the heavens stoop,
	and the heavens kiss our eyes.

coming home tonight!
the child within me quickens
at the thought.
i shall see your strong face,
feel your strong hands,
lift my warm cheek to the coolness of your own,
loved by the sun and wind,
o dearest one!
i shall hear again
in the lateness of the day
the familiar noisy tread of hob-nailed boots
heavy-caked with clay,
and catch the whiff of dust
about your clothes,
and brush the dried-up bits of mud
from off your leather coat.
and though you merely smile
in weary tenderness,
i'll see again that light within your eyes,
that one long, loving look
that tells me you are glad&glad
you've come home
for the night.

lord, i am one who seldom prayed to you,
holding that man should help himself before
using the knocker on your golden door.
and even now, when smiles are rare and few,
and want and care my daily path may strew;
when my poor children dare not ask for more
food for they must know of our empty store&
i do not know how to make prayer true.
i do not ask for anything but faith,
lord, for more faith to drive the evil wraith
of doubth that sucks my life-blood day and night,
gnawing my fount of human love away.
give me the faith that lives on, day to day,
through pain and wrack, with steadfast eye
	and bright.

i met you first
five years gone by;
	you had no wings --
	a maid so shy.
now at this dance,
my barrio girl,
	the wings are there --
	and how you fly!
when we first met
my heart was yours,
	but can i love
	this winged you?
i loved you much
five years ago -- 
	but with these wings --
	indeed, more so!

i will not hold you by restraining hands
nor yet by tears that silently accuse. 
you shall be free -- like water on the strands
that come, and go, and tarry, as they choose.
i will not speak of days sweet to remember,
of lanes we trod through april sun and shower,
of twilight trysts through early starred november,
prolonged each twilight by an evening hour --
no, not a word to hint of that or this,
lest speaking so, your going i impede.
i will resign myself to all that is --
like unto sands when cooling waves recede.
	o while the strength of seeing love undon
	still stands by me, i pray you, love, be gone.

were i to meet you face to face again
and hear your voice as in remembered days,
with mellow laughter clipped in now and then,
and note dear traces of your wonted ways,
although my claim upon you is no more,
none on your voice, your laughter, or your song,
my pride i know would sudden falter, for
i am not one to hide true feelings long.
thus, many a time while standing in a crowd,
chancing to see a form quite far apart,
built on your very lines -- tall, straight, and proud,
swiftly with anguish cries the startled heart:
"o would the man be man i never knew! -- "
yet weeps the more to learn it is not you.

we call her foreign woman, god&
burnished copper dusts are glinting from her hair;
white as the tropic sky her face; her eyes sea-blue;
like the sliver of a levant star her smile.
my eyes are dark, and, too, my hair;
and brown the flesh that shrouds my soul.
if i should die tonight and be reborn,
o, lord creator, make me too
a foreign woman to my native land.

and it was dark, but in the memory it glowed --
his face -- with memory of beauty clad
in liquid crystal leaping in a mad
jealousy to hide each little spot that showed
beneath dark tresses or cool drops that flowed
	from rounded breast to dimpled knee with glad
	rapture of motion. and thenceforth the bad
found root where lodged the seeds her beauty sowed.
so, bright against his evenings' restless gloom,
	her beauty flamed, immaculate as fire,
	that, all unknowing, warmed his grim desire
and stood for uriah as the sword of doom.
and, ever after, he heard with sudden qualms
the devil chuckling when he sang his psalms.

if all these men whose heads are with the stars,
	who dream unceasingly of blazing royalty,
will only strive to be like you,
	a dweller of the sod with heart of loyalty!

if your spirit haunt me
after you are gone,
i will not tremble with fear:
the ghosts of dead flowers
write no shadows
on the wide, white walls.

there is a woman's soul that lingers long
around my home tonight, in dreams it calls
like love; (is it the wind's soft whistling song?)
i hear it come, its foot so lightly falls,
and tiptoes on the carpet of the floor;
then like a night-thief stealing, steals from me
a kiss that keeps me dreaming, wishing more.
for i, half-feigning who this kisser be,
arose to catch the golden threads that gleamed --
now fallen fancies, broken at my feet.
would i had never waked but only dreamed
and ne'er pursued this soul i failed to meet:
it's gone, no footprint tells it graced my room;
outside is darkness, and inside is gloom.

look not for starlight
	in a rippled pool;
nor passion in her
	bosom, broken, cool.
she breathed her beauty
	on life's broidered loom;
she gifted earth with
	flowers from her womb.

mother dear, why do you have
four candles by your side?
are they to light you in your sleep
and keep the ghosts outside?
i smell the flowers on your breast,
they are so sweet and clean.
o mother, see, a butterfly
so black has fluttered in.
you told me father bringing toys
will very soon return.
i hope he comes tonight. my doll
is sick and old and worn.
mother dear, why are you cold?
why do these people weep?
-- oh, but grandma told me not
to wake you in your sleep.

forever dead, forever mute
now lies the love that once on wings
of dreams had flown beyond the stars
and sang of lovely aery things.
why is the soul endowed with gifts
to marvel at a transient flower,
to lure itself within the brief
blind ecstasies of love's green bower?
upon these ashes -- monument
to sorrow -- others will lie soon,
whoe yet will have to learn the cool
deceitful artifices of the moon.

god i debate with you about your being
but your arguments go a-circling confusing
till i believe only in the dizziness which is me
if this should go on how should you and i ever come to
a conclusion?
god!

dear god --
	 i read your advertisement in the churches
	 and i should like to have
	 a catalog of the virtues that
	 i might possibly wish to own
	 and which will finally entitle me
	 to live with you
	 in heaven.
	 it is understood that
	 this will not obligate me in any way.
	 yours very sincerely,
	 the sinner.
	 p.s. i am now living at
	 the hotel d'evil
	 but wish that
	 the catalog be addressed
	 c o the village priest.
dear god --
	the priest says
	he has not yet received
	any catalog of virtues addressed to me.
	as i am afraid that the catalog must have
	been lost on the way, i
	wish to ask you to let me
	call on you at your office
	for it on sunday
	when satan is away.
	yours very sincerely
	the sinner.
on sunday -- 
	two men stood over the body of a dead man
	on the grass.
	"he was not sick," said the doctor.
	"he is holding a cross," said the priest.

you come like the storms
to bend me to my knees.
i have not rubbed my knee-bones
on the rock-floor.
but you come
with the birghtness of candle-flames
and the darkness of your black robes
and the sad faces of your gods,
and you tell me
you will save me from eternal pain.
have i wronged your gods, o brothers?
my arrows sang into the heart
when the wild boar and the wild deer
told me i was hungry,
and the wild stranger came unknown.
i have not met your gods before.
have i wronged your gods, o brothers?
burn me in your candle-flames,
wrap me in your blackest robes,
give me your eternal pain.
but your gods, o brothers, 
they are sad-faced.

ages must pass ere once again the moon
	shall witness dalliance such as ours has been.
	leaf from a story-book! earth has not seen
love like our own that had to die so soon,
love born at dawn and in the afternoon
	dead, as all things must die, because the keen
	gusts of desire would sweep what lay between
your heart and my heart: faith and honor's boon.
fate saw our separate stars and, plaful, swerved
	their orbits that our eager wings might touch
one deathless moment. then, his caprice served,
	he swung our courses, having savored such
sweet pangs of love we had not known till then,
that now, apart, we can't be whole again.

in nara still the herons fly,
a line of snow across the sky;
the morning-glory drapes the wall;
but though the pool knows not the rain,
	the dead frog floods it still with ghosts of song.

there is quick beauty in these quiet things:
	time sitting lonely on a convent wall,
	an ancient church adrip with moss, the fall
of tears from maiden's eyes, a vine that clings
to undiscovered ruins, or far wings
	that soar in answer to a voiceless call.
	theirs is a peace that to the hearts of all
the singing ache of exquisite beauty brings.
and this is why when in the afternoon,
	sitting beside you in this room, i say
		no word nor lift my hand your arm to tap;
i only look at you, count it a boon
	to watch with silent happiness the way
		your white hands lie upon your quiet lap.

i walked last summer into the barrio of niyugan.
a pretty girl was singing at a lighted door;
now a woman sits weeping at my darkened window:
i walked last summer into the barrio of niyugan&

one april noon when all was bright,
and clear and dazzling to the sight,
	beside the road mang teban stood
	wiping his face in sullen mood.
he saw the heat waves in the glare
	as devils on a stage afire --
and chafed in the sultry air --
	and wished for the rainy days!
then when salt sold at treble price
and muddy pools mocked cloudy skies,
	mang teban, passing dripping trees,
	with trousers rolled up to his knees,
reproached the sky and saw the rain
	as diablos dancing in the mire --
and shrank in the pelting rain --
	and wished for the sunny days!

one thing at least is certain -- this life flies,
but one? a shooting star darts forth aflame,
kindles a span, then leaves the sky the same.
yet not the same for in that flaming guise
has burst a trail of glory in the skies
as back to naught dissolves. and well it came:
that star -- the view to profit by its aim --
has splashed night's darkling mantle ere it dies.
from naught to naught, a breathing space, we dip
in earth's live air, yet not for naught designed,
lest all our gifts be vain. the full-rigged ship
sails not the seas of worthy purpose blind.
we leave a wake of glory or a strip
of light, then life may fly for we shall find.

but yesterday i sang a hymn of faith,
not knowing what the morrow may provoke;
i flattered life and plucked the beard of death,
not knowing one recedes, the other comes.
but o my soul, despair not; still hold on
to what remains, grasp thou with all thy might
the slim cord hanging from the highest clouds&
perchance up at the other end a host
of angels bright are tugging at that cord
to take thee to the bosom of thy god.

i have not known such freedom til tonight
when looking on the vastness of the sea,
i passed into the darkness and the light
encompassing me&

i am brother to the rock whereon i sit,
brother to that star shivering in the sky;
and the sigh of the wind kissing my hair
is my own sigh.
share with me your strength, o my rock-brother!
let me wrap my coat around you, o star!
what has broken your heart, o sister wind
wandering from afar?

these be the questions which asleep or waking
cover my conscience with a nameless pain:
the flight of atoms and their constant breaking
through million years to make a star again;
and that mysterious door through which unknowing
i entered to discover i am i,
knowing not whither henceforth going
i fly from life, through death, beyond the sky.
and what am i, or god, and why does laughter
sound hollow in a universe soaked with tears?
and am i free, or have the gods looked after
my fate from the beginning of the years?
pensive i listen, anxious for the light --
i hear contentious voices in the night.

if i should die ere all my songs are sun,
give me a piece of ground where i may lie
in sweet ropose. i would not grieve nor sigh
nor ask for one more moment among
my friends when life's last bell has rung,
for this i know too well: if i should die,
a blad of grass will spring and grow where i
in slumber rest. and so, mute though my tongue,
the blade of grass would be my lyre and song;
my dust would give it life, and it would bloom 
and tell mf many lovely things: the long,
long dreams of one who sleeps beneath the tomb,
	the beauteous wealth that lies hid in the sod,
	the greatness of my maker and my god.

i had a mad desire
to snatch the moon
from its prison of bare branches;
to watch it shimmering
in beautiful tremulousness
within my fingers.
low on the ridge of a hill
it hung atilt
like a bowl
of white cold flame;
a wild laughter shattered
the brittle quietude,
and exulting i caught the moon
glinting within my fingers.
you must stay here, i said,
within my heart,
so that the red, live flame
of passion there
shall flicker and die
with your yellow breath,
o moon, cold moon.

in the evening,
the river-winds take the village
in their arms,
whispering fragments of old lost songs;
and, pulling a blanket of dreams
over the sleeping roofs,
softly, softly move on&

you want the pearl beneath the sea,
o you of many dreams?
i have but cool, red clay and sand
beneath my woodland streams.

i saw two spiders spitting out long threads to the moon,
	but the moon was so high up in the sky
	that the silk threads fell to the ground.
so the spiders wove a net on two slender twigs
	to catch the moon.
in the evening, there were many dewdrops
	on the web the spiders wove,
	and the spiders said, we have caught many moons.
then there were the worms i saw one morning on a leaf,
	green wriggly things with spots of blue and yellow,
	measuring off inches on the edge of the leaf
	till the leaf was a fretwork of intricate beauty.
i am a worm, i said to myself, eating off the leaf of life;
	when the leaf falls, i fall with it.

and jupiter enraged fashioned the curse:
	pandora, lovely woman, gift of all
	the gods; that forthwith evil shall befall
mankind, beauty they gave the charmer; worse:
a golden casket vulcan-forged; and so
	that she might tempted be, the gods forbad
	the creature to unlock the lid, but made
her doubly curious. not siwft but slow
the tortures that she felt each our she gazed
	upon the cash, knowing she must not know
		nor see what gilded splendor lay within;
but when she disobeyed, the gods amazed
	no ugly nightmares in the box they saw;
		only sweet pain and the loveliness of sin.

a moment yet before "good-bye"
	and "god watch o'er you on the way";
a word or two, a parting sight,
a moment yet before good-bye.
i bad you go? 'twas but a lie,
	for did my heart not whisper stay
a moment yet before? good-bye,
and god watch o'er you on the way!

i think of you not when the hours
are soft and winds are murmuring low;
nor do, amid earth's lovely flow'rs,
	i think of you.
remembrance breeds naught but woe
when nurtured 'midst sweet-scneted bow'rs,
and bitterness doth grow.
i think of you when bacchus show'rs
wild joys, and nights a revel show;
when wine and song corrupt my pow'rs,
	i think of you.

you asked of me to still the voice
of love that in my heart would be.
my friend mine never was the choice
	you asked of me.
i drowned that passion in a sea
of wine and song; and other joys
i have, -- bartered and give nfree.
and now you ask why love employs
men like myself. can you not see,
my friend, that mine ne'er was the choice
	you asked of me.

i trod the old familiar streets and places,
warmed my heart at each long-remembered scene
of which i sang in exile; saw the faces
of kith and kin (some furrowed, some serene)
discard the years and grow more soft at meeting;
i hied my homesick self all through the day
to every corner of the village, greeting
friends of my youth, now growing old and gray.
and yet tonight beside this golden sea
that sleepy murmurs to the sore, i dream
of other scenes and days no more to be;
my spirit rushes with the hurrying stream
	hard by my rustic cottage, on its way
	into another sea -- far, far away.

up the old and torturous road to payaman,
at early morn before the mists arise,
a barefoot hatless lad
sits astride upon his favorite bull;
and as he slowly ascends the hills
that guard the twon below
he softly sings a song,
a sad and haunting melody
as old as the vale behind him.

when tales of gold in distant makaweli
have lured him far away,
perhaps never to return;
or when the reeds shall bend
and whisper above his silent tomb --
another barefoot lad,
sitting upon another bull,
shall ascend the hills at early morn.
and in time, he too shall disappear&
and that song of the hills,
that sad and haunting melody,
shall still be sung by other lads
in the centuries yet unborn.

my thoughts are strong desires
winging their way to god!
but each time i behold young bamboos
reaching upward, seeking his throne,
only to bend their heads to earth at last,
i, too, conquered, am silent.

were i to be entombed some years to come,
i would that i be laid beneath the trees;
no marble stone, no epitaph must stand
over my mound; but let night's silent calm
companion me. or let the distant seas
with music trailing softly o'er the sand
sing me at last to my eternal sleep;
but let none heave a sigh or weep!

last night, i woke from my dreams --
i saw god with forgiving eyes
in the young moon kissing my face;
in the wide silence dreaming on the hills;
and in the soft throbbing breast
of my wife asleep & !

my dear, my dear, canst thou resolve for me
this paradox of love concerning thee:
mine eyes, when opened, with thy beauty fill --
but when they're closed they see thee better still!

these were the fortresses, o spain,
old worn, and darkened by time, --
they never will be thine again
tho' they were fadeless in thy rhyme.
manila! and her haughty walls --
yea, and they speak of grandeur gone,
there is a spirit that enthralls
the awed beholder when alone.
he seems at night to hear the tread
of governor and halberdier,
the priest among the sick and dead
strewing his blessings far and near.
he seems to hear the martial voice
of goiti, warding hard the sword
of sioco&and that desperate noise
warned the castilian sleeping lord,
until salcedo the young knight
drove sioco's chief from place to place
-- the chinese fled in his disgrace.
gray venerable walls! ye speak
a language mightier tha nthe lyre --
the march of seasons did not break
thy glories that the mind inspire.
and when the charmed spectator hies
him in the dullness of his room,
he cannot banish from his eyes
the scene of native marytrdom.
who felt the keen castilian sword?
who knelt before the kick and scorn?
who swallowed foul word after word?
who was of rights and powers shorn?
who built those walls, our wonder now?
who piled the stone, and stored the lime,
who ailed and died of heat and crow,
who perished in their lusty prime?
ye answer, for ye know it well --
i need not play with melodies,
your austere form can better tell
men's mocked lives and miseries.

who is this bold impudent wight
breaking the quiet of this night&
who art thou? -- thy smell is death,
and incese is thy ghastly breath.
what dost thou by these olden walls
where birds sing no more madrigals?
why dost thou loiter at this hour,
what midnight has thee in its pow'r?
thy look is grim, thy eyes flash fire,
what deeper hate can them inspire?
am i thy foe -- what did i do
that i should merit terror so?
then pale and shrill tones waved on air,
white seemed and pale those ruins bare,
'i am a faithful son of spain,
spectre now walking in vain
this darksome hour the riven stones
that heard my haunting wail, my groans.
a governor who ruled was i,
but in this loneliness i sight,
yet pride to think that i did good
against the friars' brotherhood.
one friar thought he was more high,
my sanctioned power did e'en defy;
he deemed he was the governor
before whom all quail and adore.
there was a soldier under me,
a female slave of looks had he,
and killed her, and refuge did seek
in go'ds house. the bishop weak
as stubborn as he was, disdained
to give to law what was ordained.
my brother's son i sent to take
the murderer for justice's sake;
the murderer died&the bishop's ire
was lit, and spread like fire.
he banned me, cursed and censured me,
such was his pride, such his vanity.
then gave me yet greatest pain,
he treated cruelly the swain.
my king, o justice! & fie with friars!
fie with them and their desires,
i cried, the bishop waxed more bold,
i wrapped him in the prison's fold.
but, alas! i never knew
that fades all power's haughty show,
that lord can stumble down
and tremble 'neath the enemy's frown.
i it was in the fort confined
while bishop and successor wined
on my fall.
	thus i perished here,
a beggar, that once had no peer.'
art though, art thou? -- 
	memory
forgot the whims of history.
'twas dawn, and the glimmering stars
were retreating in night's wars.
art thou&?
	then as he flew, cried:
"saddest corcuera!"

tis true that men, when vain conceit doth sway,
are like their brother-fools of yesterday.
they write a hackneyed story and they think
they are alone the true connecting link
between us and de maupassant and poe
and giant-men of pen the world doth know.
they are the towering marvels of this age,
each screed of theirs our glorious heritage
each story they belabor is pride of art,
each word or comma touchees deep the heart.
each long, uncertain dash reveals the state
of inspiration genius doth create;
and every trash they write bears white perfection;
woe to the wight who dares attempt correction!
he will be damned, maligned, and cursed by them.
is not each sentence they indite a gem?
o vain, deluded men, cry not so loud,
you are not great but small and vile and proud!
for surfeit with the wind of your conceit,
like swollen frog you fall in doom most meet.
who fooled you with that madcap flattery
that you were made for immortality?
who stirred your minds and told that you are high,
your giant-forms deep shadows in the sky?
the jackdaw strutted 'mong the peacocks bright,
in purloined feathers he himself did dight.
but the birds born lordly did see too well 
how false, unnatural and poor did dwell
the custom of a borrowed dignity,
and drove the imposter quick in contumely.
think not you are the best of men, the elect;
like ours, poor still your vaunted intellect.
by chance you frame a story, phrase a line:
deem not on you bestowed heaven's gifts divine!
the sboer men who satch will only laugh
to see you prize so high the worthless chaff.
forego those proud, long footsteps. only time
true worth and genuine fame will loudly chime.
i trust you pardon me, take no offense,
when i say what you need is common sense.

fleet, nimble beings,
birds in the church,
'neath painted ceilings
flying to perch
on sacred casements
hallowed by prayer,
solemnly soaring
like hymns through air!
airy church-goers,
come you to pray?
to hear chants sweeter
than woodland play?
or come you here to search for a home?
for peace unknown in
glades where you roam?
come you to thank him
for cool green gras,
for trees, lakes, meadows
where young winds pass?
for blooms nectareal,
for clear, blue skies?
for twitt'ring birdies
with brilliant eyes?
we are both only
live bits of clod;
through you i know more 
myself and god.

the trembling fingers lit the quiv'ring match,
	the linen paper like a lone leaf wavers;
	a thought arrests the tongue of flame that quavers,
and like the fire which once her heart did catch,
the light dies out. she knew their contents well,
	the blue, white, rose-pink messages she sent;
	she tied the ribbon by much handling spent,
as one by one her tears unbidden fell.
they wre to her as perfumes rare and old
	of younger years ere love had taken wing,
	and life was kind and mem'ry had no sting;
tokens of passions with their fires grown cold,
	bur burning them would soften not the smart --
these dear, these long-wept children of her heart.

whether i dwell within the heart of you,
	i must know.
tomorrow when the daylight lights the sky,
	words must fly.
on your window -- three potted loveliness, 
	meaning yes.
or two flower pots their green beauty show,
	meaning no.
the sunbeams gleam upon your window sill;
	all is still.
a row of flowers fair, each one a gem;
	five of them!

tall cogon grass wind-swaying on a hill.
it catches fire! then quickly it invades
the hills with burning feet and stabs the glades
with daggers of vermilion flames that fill
the ebon night, naught leaving but the lame
cold aspect of the hillsides cinder-scarred.
so people say with accents falling hard:
"fervent and strong but brief as cogon flame."
yet cogon grass no red flames can devour;
theirs is a sermon of submission sweet;
theirs is a tale of calm persistency;
ere a few suns have set, their roots reflower,
bring forth green song, and then with patient feet
reclothe the hills with magic greenery.

there is no loveliness like that of islands,
fading to bluish as the boat receds;
there is no beauty kin to that of highlands
growign more green as the swift banca leads
to strips of seashore sanded white and palmed.
islands are lovely, with green-mantled crowns,
with rocky headlands, tree-girth coves becalmed,
and wave-sprayed capes, and hidden little towns.
islands are sea-nymphs that at twilight cloak
their persons with a mild serenity;
they are a devout and submissive folk
to whom the heavens are no mystery;
knowing the stars, they lightly bear the yoke
of winds that rule the mountains and the sea.

here only the thin wind
the deep silence mars;
here night seems always
spread thick with stars.
i muse by my window,
and a child am i
beneath roof of nipa,
beneath palm of sky.
the dark heavens are coffins
'neath heaven's blue bowl;
the winds fling back dirges
and the late dogs howl.
the treetops aquiver
spell mystery, fear;
above them is splendor
and beauty austere.
o night for the going
of me on the tide!
with beauty above me,
and death by my side!

as from a sleep profound,
a long time in strange ground, 
i woke to find my soul
young as, when faint with thirst
of love, i knoew it first:
invincible and whole.
and this was all so strange,
this change-annulling change,
which brought what passed before;
and strange it was to me,
in whom a memory 
survived of what was o'er.
for, as i live, i know
there was a long ago
and recent yesterday,
a time of fleeting pleasure
and sorrows without measure
that came, and passed away.
and surely, as i stand
above this wondrous strand,
i lived to love for years
in vain, and of the morrow
lost hope in my deep sorrow,
and yet recall the tears.
and surely, too, i say,
for yet an older day
the soul-progenitor
of my own soul had lived
as i, and joyed, or grieved,
whiche'er the fate he bore.
a past existed surely,
howe'er came sweetly, purely,
this wondrous hour i see;
and now so strange to seem
yet true, that with a dream
the past is what may be!
and surely was my land
ruled by an iron hand,
and wrapped in midnight's gloom.
these clouds and skies that o'er
me smile, i saw before,
not there; so whence, from whom?
for not in my own country,
where foreign flag and sentry
o'erdarken the fair land,
would this rich evening glow,
for sight of slave to show,
nor bless the tyrant's hand.
a dream! a dream! and all
my pristine strength of soul
returns from yesterday,
unbound from chains of time,
triumphant as the slime 
and man's first animate clay.
a dream! and nothing less,
a great, divine caress
of grief and memory,
across the fields of time,
from death to life sublime
it holds eternity.

set me adrift on the bay tonight,
tonight when the gray winds blow,
over the waves to the western stars
my banca and i must go.
you would have built me an altar here
where lingers the wave-born dew,
and i would have taken the silver dusk
to gather young dreams for you.
but the western lagoons and the lonely stars--
they whisper across the sea,
and i must away to a misty shore
that calls through the dark to me.
then set me adrift on the bay tonight,
tonight when the gray winds blow,
and over the waves to the western stars
evening and i will go.

it was a sacrilege, the neighbors cried,
the way she shattered every mullioned pane
to let a firebrand in. they tried in vain
to understand how one so carved from pride
and glassed in dream could have so flung aside
her graven days, or why she dared profane
the bread and wine of life for one insane
moment with him. the scandal never died.
but no one guessed that loveliness would claim
her soul's cathedral burned by his desires,
or that he left her aureoled in flame&
and seeing nothing but her blackened spires,
the town condemned this girl who loved too well
and found her heaven in the depths of hell.

with stars i tryst, and in the outmost night,
time, thundering, roams the skies;
i fear the alteration of the light -- 
love, let me look into your eyes. 
a funeral wind is moaning through the trees,
and man so soon departing from his birth
saddens the sould and bids its fever cease
with grief that lifts its question from the earth.
i confuse time and space as one, and fear
identity, o woman, friend, and wife;
the boughs of trees, seem human, gods disappear -- 
o share with me this terror of life!

i've found you fruits of sweetest taste and found you
bunches of duhat growing by the hill,
i've boung your arms and hair with vine and bound you
with rare wildflowers but you are crying still.
i've brought you all the forest ferns and brought you
wrapped in green leaves cicadas singing sweet,
i've caught you in my arms and hour and taught you
love's secret where the mountain spirits meet.
your smiles have died and there is no replying
to all endearment and my gifts are vain;
come with me, love, you are too old for crying,
the church bells ring and i hear drops of rain.

rose in her hand, and moist eyes young with weeping,
she stands upon the threshold of her house;
frangrant with scent that wakens love from sleeping,
she looks far down to where her husband plows.
her hair dhshevelled in the night of passion,
her warm limbs humid with the sacred strife,
what may she know but man and woman fashion
out of the clay of wrath and sorrow -- life?
she holds no joys beyond the day's tomorrow,
she finds no worlds beyond her love's embrace;
she looks upon the form behind the furrow,
who is her mind, her motion, time, and space.
o somber mystery of eyes unspeaking,
o dark enigma of life's love forlorn;
the sphinx beside the river smiles with seeking
the secret answer since the world was born. 

'mid stalks low-binding with sun-ripened grian,
you loomed upon my ravished, sinful eyes;
i listened lost in wondering surprise,
while in the evening rang your sweet refrain.
weeping, i wished i were some village swain,
and like him quietened into looks and sighs,
your face to love till in me should arise
an olden whisper lifting life from pain.
child-heart, for whom no cup of sorrow fills,
in innocence these valleys dwell among;
here, by the murmur of the mountain rills,
live, where love's word to utter seems but wrong;
love were only sorrow to your heart of song,
and i would hear no singing in the hills.

when i, in love with folly and with pride,
denounced my god and kin with words of fire,
transformed my clean surroundings into mire,
destroyed my idols, threw the cross aside,
and in my wild and wayward life of shame,
gave vent to crazy dreams and follies all,
allowed my once pure soul in me to fall,
i saw that i was heading for the flame;
now, when i find that i am all alone,
bereft of love, of faith, and friends once mine,
and in the spot where there once stood a shrine,
i find a heap of ruin'd life -- my own!
	i reel beneath the weight of sin, i cry:
	"for such as i, you sent a son to die!"

the rude, moist breath of this november night
recalls one such an eve a year ago
when sonia stole away from me
with tender care i put her letter-blocks,
her dainty dolls, and little things away,
so poignant mem'ry's mockery might fail
to bring remembrancers of little nimble feet
at first a power grips the chain of life
to keep the soul from fleeing sorrow's thrust,
then pain, so fast in coming, slow to go,
destroys and builds through dread and dreary days,
and holds me 'twixt dark doubt and dreadful death.
there is a meaning behind all these, i'm sure, 
and sorrow comes to tell me what it is:
	is it that we may find
the love and life we've lost -- from where they came?
am i but shedding pagan's tears of doubt,
that cannot see what lies beyond the grave?
if it is littleness, oh lord, for man
never to have known where knowing costs so much,
'twere better, god willing, i'd never known at all,
but now, "god's will be done and not mine own."

night and a starry sky
	and a voice cold and still;
soft, lingering twilight
	atop a sapphire hill.
night and dead desires
	and love as keen as pain --
hope that is lost forever
	and will not rise again.

waking dawn and woodland call,
	where are you today?
give the breath of may-ing flowers
	just a dream of yesterday.
have you watched the flaming sunset
	slowly die away?
i have felt its throbbing pulses
	in my dream of yesterday.
fondly have this prisoned being
	long and pined away
for the freshness of the moonlight
	that was our yesterday.
youth and songs and flowers,
	where are you today?
i would change my present being
	for a breath of yesterday.

i cannot learn the music strain
	that glides on other foam,
for far-off voices and the rain
	proclaim that realm a home.
is it the voice of forlorn maids
	that sing of bliss and peace,
or trumpet sound of midnight raids,
	of soldier souls and seas?
is it the heartbreak of a song,
	that wells from some despair;
an ancient note that thoughts prolong,
	from silver streaks of hair?
is it a midnight serenade,
	a wafted song of old;
the footfalls of a peasant maid,
	in ashes past and cold.
she cannot come and yet her voice,
	a solace from the past,
exhaust the fountain of my joys -- 
	in life that cannot last.
that voice from one celestial bow'r,
	the trill of angel lips, 
is all the nectar of my flow'r
	my heart in dying sips!

tonight i am the sea,
my mistress -- earth;
i fling my arms about my love
to kiss in mirth,
to kiss in love.
her rocky shoulders rise
above my lips and eyes;
i quail and creep away
beyond, beyond, in search of day -- 
or night and peace&
but -- returning and ever returning
dun waves of diaphanous seas,
i come with the sunsets burning,
i come with the moon-white breeze!

i shall not sing to love again,
	a tired and empty voice is mine;
but i can wait once more in pain
	where ghostly moonlights creeping shine
on ruined walls in mist and rain.
this was the house i built with song,
	its pillars spelled a nameless name;
but now unsinging echoes throng
	where once her answer limpid came&
and wait i shall, but god! how long?

a field of snow
where grackles hold
consultation
about the cold.

my love
is like the grass
hidden in the deep mountains;
though its abundance increases,
there is none that knows.

spring blossom of a distant land,
	what tidings do you bring to me?
the warm clasp of a loving hand,
	a soul steadfast in consistency.
i would behold you where you blow,
	and roam again your pale-blue clime
with that dear friend of a long ago
	but dear-remembered maying-time.
sweet flower that makes my heart rejoice,
	my verse shall hold you in its line--
the echo of a silver voice,
	a loving pledge for memory's shrine.

little sampaguita,
with the wandering eye,
did a tiny fairy
drop you where you lie?
in the witching hour
of a tropic night,
did a careless moonbeam
leave you in its flight?

i knock at the gate of your heart;
only the hollow rustling of dead leaves
answers my call.
what if a blight has passed 
to see the beauty within?
i shall be the dew
to awaken the parched grass;
i shall be the color
to make stark trees gay,
the sunlight to dispel the gloom
and give new life.
i am love.
open the door to me.

statues on the altar,
darkened by coming night;
yonder a cross
in fitful candlelight.
and from high above, 
tuneful sound of bells;
the angelus rings --
of peace, and mercy, prayer,
	it tells.
dies the din of the world,
stilled the fevered pace;
with the angel of the lord --
"hail mary, full of grace!"

the angels guard your night
	till weariness be gone,
and bring to smooth your brows
	soft fingers of the dawn.
may trees their rootlets send
	to kiss your dreaming eyes,
while shyly from your breast
	pink makahiya arise.

eyelids like a feather's edge,
	tresses long, and black as night;
lips and cheeks like jasmine blooms,
	smilkes and looks -- a soul's delight!
and those ivory-white teeht peeping
	while she laughs as lovers sigh --
will you envy if i worship
	fair rosario of sagay?
grace is in her ev'ry motion,
	for a woodland nymph is she,
dainty dancing fairies taught her
	in their moonlight froilcs free;
and her breath, 'tis mixt with odor
	of kananga rose kept dry --
will you tease me if i rave over
	fair rosario of sagay?
met her walking in the garden
	while the twilight sun sank low;
came the whisperings of romances
	of the golden long ago;
she the beauteous maid forlorn, 
	and her armed knight was i,
vowed forever to defend her,
	fair rosario of sagay!

the philippines' principal products
	are sugar and politicians.
in one there is money,
	 in the other extravagance.

my happy days have passed away,
	the hills and woods have lost their flowers,
where is my may?
	where are its sweet and charming hours?
cheer me, my star, and give me light
	to see at least a pleasant way, 
show me your eyes so fair and bright
	to find my may!
with thoughts of care i bend my head,
	where is my may?
i am along, i eat my bread
	away from you, so far away.

come to me, beloved mother,
	for my heart's about to die,
and my fate would yield no other
	consolation than to cry.
stormy clouds are ever rolling
	with a roar over my head,
while far from tee i am strolling
	'midst the gloom of mortal dread.
life to me has lost its glamour,
	dead the things i deem the best,
mother, come, o heed my clamour,
	ere my last eternal rest.
come and tell me why, when dreaming
	found my heart a thorny way,
why my stars of yore a-gleaming
	are extinguished all to-day.
come to me, beloved mother,
	for my pang bids me to cry,
and my fate would yield no other 
	consolation than to die&

the steel your hands have wielded,

	in days of youre

	and fed by fruit
	or bitter root,
fought on and knew no rest.
that heritage, or bulwark
in all the days to be,
	we'll cherish still
	from every ill,
the heirloom of the free!

my life's to-morrow beckons me
	from distant mountains high and low,
my future seems a boundless sea
	where moving passions come and go.
deep in my heart ambition swells;
	he cheers me up the highland way
and guides me through the hills and dells
	wherein i pass the busy day.
i cannot write with shakespeare's pen,
	but i can love with shakespeare's heart;
i love his skill and craft of men,
	the master of the poet's art.
i do not care for fame, as he,
	enthroned, did feel himself a god;
the depths he passed are dark to me,
	but i will grope the ways he trod.
i wear achievement's coronet,
	for blest are they who see things done!
and all my cares i soon forget
	when i have wrought my work alone.
if i be met by adverse fate,
	and all my dreams be but in vain,
then must i work the harder yet
	with high resolve to try again.

the time draws near, my guest, but stay,
stay yet a while. let me now muse
on thy short life. bearst thou away
some thing which i would gladly lose?
has thy great book a page for me
wherein my petty deeds are writ?
does it abount in tasks to be 
and work undone and marks unhit?
in glaring black, i charge thee well,
portray my heart and all its shade, 
and all its joys -- though few there dwell --
and all its griefs, let them not fade.
but no! o no! leave that alone --
awakening love! i have it hid
within me deep; leave it unknown
till it o'ergrows and flies unbid.
a dreamer hast thou said am i,
who scorns to live our common life?
blot out that line: 'tis but a lie;
warrior i am in this great strife.
then turns my guest his parting face
and looks at me and stares at me
and chides me thus: "from long, long days
a dreamer thou hast proved to be!
ah! this vision evermore --
to trim thy fancy's gorgeous wing,
far in the land of dreams to soar,
and all the while to lisp and sing!
alas thou'rt not for this bold age,
where songs of love and truth are drowned
amidst the metals' tinkling rage,
and bards with cold disdain are crowned!"
then silently he treads the stair
and faintly now his steps i hear;
more silently sat in his chair
another guest, the calm new year.

	good-bye, my lady, now must we part,
but over the ocean i'll think of thee;
and thy sweet face will live in my heart:
oh then, my lady, be true to me.
	away in that far-off, distant land,
amid the stranger and unknown,
still shall i recall the clasp of thy hand
and the sigh that says thy heart is my own.
	good-bye my lady, one fond embrace
ere i depart from laoag's shore,
one loving smile from thy sweet face
to cheer me as the breakers roar.
	good-bye, my lady, do not despair
for later, i'll return to thee,
and bring thee costly presents rare
from beauteous isles across the sea.

when mortal bosoms grieve with thee no more
and thou, alone, doth feel despairing care,
walk thou the woodland fanes and there implore
each lovely blossom all thy woe to share;
roam where the trees, like the apostles old,
in solemn silence sacred thoughts impart,
and with their spirits sweet communion hold
to teach thee have a more resigned heart.
more tender sympathy thou still shalt find
in nature's breast than in a mortal's soul;
for thee is pity more sincere, more kind
that feigns no warmth, and never knows a goal;
	and if this blessing solace to thee yields,
	dare not profane god's temples in the fields.

a light serene, ethereal glory, rests
its beams effulgent on each cresting wave;
the silver touches of the moonlight lave
the deep's bare bosom that the breeze molests;
while lingering whispers deepend as the wavy crests
roll with weird rhythm, now gay, now gently grave;
and floods of lambent light appear the sea to pave --
all cast a spell that heeds not time's behests.
not always such the scene: the din of fight
has swelled the murmur of the peaceful air;
here east and west have oft displayed their might;
dark battle clouds have dimmed this scene so fair;
	here bold olympia, one historic night,
	presaging freedom, claimed a people's care.

woe, melancholy, thy voice i hear,
art thou unholy, thou ever near?
in each dry atom crushed by my feet
a cry i fathom -- thy sad retreat.
i feel thy essence in joys to-day;
their faded presence will form thy day.
art thou not living in virgin sighs
whose cruel misgiving on me now lies?
for withered flowers whose future dusts
shall find new bowers in other lusts,
my tears deploring can claim from thee,
thou still ignoring, no sympathy.

'tis time, my heart, thou shouldst not ask
	if there were something more
than starry form and scented hue
	the faded violets bore.
nor ask to knoww why they have bloomed
	to leave thee but their dust,
why lips have yielded to thine own,
	and whispered broken trust.

in the shady woods i know
where the bashful jungle fowls are keeping
their helpless young. they are below
the trees by which the rill is weeping.
beneath the rapid's frown
where the white ripples madly run,
there is where i have known
fair itubi is courted by luran.
and if to me twere only known
where the heron's eggs are laid
in the deep still river's bed,
they were treasures rare to own.

thou dreamer of melancholy songs,
	what heritage is thine? --
the epic line in all things fair,
	its harmony is mine.
their eden joy and lingering pain,
	they pass into my soul,
for joy and pain have melodies
	that through my being roll.
and less are science and philosophy
	than an immortal line
whose notes sublime in mortal man
	may reach the man divine.
and heir am i to a sweet desire
	to charm from out all things
truth's essence that to the spirit yields
	themes for its murmurings:
ah! not a rose with cankered leaves
	but claims from me a sigh;
and not a maid with lyric grace
	but wakes a lyric cry.
what is't to gaze at a virgin's face
	and read the love that's there?
a lily seen in the dusk of dawn
	is not more pure more fair.
each feeling finds an echo
	in ev'ry beauty that i see;
the music of their form, their poetry --
	a heritage for me.

had he come to the world, with the red flag unfurled,
all his mercy but lust, that our honor be dust;
all his love but lies, that our faith which dies
be as shadows fading, dumb on the hills,
would our joys be more and less our ills?
what to me in m bondage, a slave, not free,
brings the crucified christ in far galilee?
were it hate, not love, that looks from his eyes,
would the rose be green and red the skies,
and my hand not heavy with an empty prize?
not the craven creed nor the threat unhurled
nor his love that keeps the red flag yet furled,
but the red of his blood and the gleam of steel
and his seven wounds that make us feel
that today his heart is the heart of the world.
oh, for a christ without the cross!
for a wounded christ to restore my loss!
for a christ, not god, but king of man!
for a christ to lead, a god in the van!
for a christ to conquer in a conquered land!

the ocean breezes breathed
over the vastness of the plains below,
imperial silence: ethereal peace -- 
and the majestic sweep of the seas beyond, --
what slow measured dirge
the breakers speak along the shores!

and he is carried back in dreams
to the beautiful sundown of his ili-na.
there is the music of young laughter.
he well remembers now his old friendships,
the long-lost ties of long ago.
there he sits under the shadows of the bells
at vesper-time.
the scenes are different now.
the voices are not the same he used to hear.
he is all alone now in the world,
for he feels strange himself.
seemingly out of place.
seemingly miscarried by the current of time.
he stands to go. he cannot go.
for the scent of azucena at sundown
brings back to him
the long-lost ties of long ago.

after the rain,
darkness lifts to luminous acres
of space above --
and earth's sweet scents
breathe anew.

silent are the trails of benguet hills
when the mist veils the sun --
even when the wind stirs the ferns
and the bamboo brakes sing
their echoed murmurs,
and the laden benguet women pass,
beating their pakkongs
in cadenced monotones --
even so,
these trails are lonely&
and deep are the ravines,
and higher still the skies.

when you came,
i was nowhere to be found.
you wept.
i wept too for i was lonely and bound
where you could not see.
i heard your footsteps with the wind,
treading the long path;
and i saw the dreams in your eyes;
and i felt your breath upon my being --
but i was lonely and bound.

you will sing again for me;
you will mould my soul with the soil
by your tears of joy in the being:
i shall arise in the lowly grass
whereon you tread.

i can only hear your voice
through the darkness.
and as it passees by,
it seems as if the word
for which i groped in being
illumined the void
and again is lost.
you chose ever to remain veiled
in my presence.

inglorious martyr of democracy,
you whose prophetic mind foresaw the law
and present groundwork of our common life:
	pioneer
of filipino rights, who stirred the bood
of brothers to the action of the strife
	and made the despots quail!
defiant proletaire, whose spirits rose
undaunted from our past colonial woe;
	we hear you: in the noise
of angry cataracts, your restless soul
utters its feearless protest, in the fall
of mighty torrents, your imperius voice
	resounds with liberty!
you are where mountains totter from their free,
ethereal eminence, where eagles sweep
down to their end, in precipices deep,
to languish there unknown, unsung -- to sleep
	the sleep of wounded pride!
how much your doctrines in our midst abide,
in sanctuaries time may not despoil,
how much we hark to your immortal call,
	genius of human toil!
and on this day, when every native home
offers its flowers to your memory,
heaer martyred champion of democracy,
your brother toilers, contrite at your feet,
raise their vehement prayers to the sky
	to bless your martyrdom,
and in the language of their souls repeat
	your libertarian cry!

if you should ask me what this means--
these pealing bells that break the hush
of early morns, these rustic scenes
of merriment, this tireless rush
of children's feet;
if you should ask why all this whirr
of restless wings, these songs that rend
the air with joy, this festive stir
and laughter sweet, --
if you must know what these portend --
then feel the touch, the magic cheer
of christmas spreading far and near
the message of the pristine star --
the light that silenced mortal fear
and blessed with radiance, sweet and mild,
the manger of the holy child.
joy is here; love has returned
to human hearts that rankled, burned, 
but yesterday, with fires of greed;
christmas has brought its tender meed
of goodwill and diadem
of peace from ancient bethlehem.
i feel the tumult in the air,
the trembling riot of delights
that stirs the memory;
far in the night the flick'ring lights
burn in fantastic lanterns red
to conjure up the ghosts for me --
the ghosts of love forever dead.
laughter of childhood free from care
through days of frolic unconfined,
sweet smiles of faces fair that cast
their beauty in the starlit night;
the elder hands held out by right
of sweet tradition for the kiss
of veneration by the young;
gay carols in the churches sung,
and gifts the rich and poor must share -- 
these joys, these haunting scenes of bliss,
these bright romances of the past
come back to crowd the anguished mind,
to fill the heart with yearnings kind.
god's love is here; hatred has fled;
no more the pang of envy mars
the thought of mortal tongue and pen.
under the ancient, fadeless stars
a hungering world feeds on the bread
of common joy; the cloud of shame
has ceased to blur the human ken
as angels from above proclaim
peace on this earth, goodwill to men.

come, lay the dead love out,
	and close his vacant eyes
that once shone with the light
	and hope of paradise.
unbend the rounded limbs
	so perfect still in death,
lay by the harmless bow
	and poison arrow sheath.
fold back the broken wings
	that now shall mount no more,
though once beyond the stars
	the godlike child they bore.
yes, take my hand again,
	though we be parted wide,
and for a moment's space
	go softly by my side!
while once more, as of old,
	a common pain we brave,
and bear our dearest dead
	together to the grave.

the air is stirless and the sky is bare,
	one tremblin star alone allures the sight
	as though the great way, dream-gown of the night,
were fastened with a tiny solitaire.
when lo! beyond the distant hills, somewhere
	an opal gloom reflects a sudden light
	that languorously looms and grows more bright
till that far space seems filmed with golden air.
then wonderfully as a dream comes true,
	the rising moon emerges, large and round,
		and boat-like glides on the night's deep-hushed lagoon,
shedding a lustre as intense and new
	as though the incas' buried gold were found
		and molten into one huge yellow moon.

but scarce her wounds could heal, gores yet fresh,
the wailing cries still linger in the breeze,
that mighty eagle from across the sea
came, shedding patriots' blood, forced liberty
to give her key, and banished from this isle
who will not yield, who will not reconcile.
what could a handful do against a host? --
leonidas e'en perished, tho not lost!

listen, my children, and you shall hear
of the midnight ride of paul revere,
on the eighteenth of april, in seventy-five:
hardly a man is now alive 
who remembers that famous day and year.
he said to his friend, “if the british march
by land or sea from the town to-night,
hang a lantern aloft in the belfry-arch
of the north-church-tower, as a signal-light,--
one if by land, and two if by sea;
and i on the opposite shore will be,
ready to ride and spread the alarm
through every middlesex village and farm,
for the country-folk to be up and to arm.”
then he said “good night!” and with muffled oar
silently rowed to the charlestown shore,
just as the moon rose over the bay,
where swinging wide at her moorings lay
the somerset, british man-of-war:
a phantom ship, with each mast and spar
across the moon, like a prison-bar,
and a huge black hulk, that was magnified 
by its own reflection in the tide.
meanwhile, his friend, through alley and street
wanders and watches with eager ears, 
till in the silence around him he hears 
the muster of men at the barrack door,
the sound of arms, and the tramp of feet, 
and the measured tread of the grenadiers 
marching down to their boats on the shore.
then he climbed to the tower of the church,
up the wooden stairs, with stealthy tread,
to the belfry-chamber overhead,
and startled the pigeons from their perch
on the sombre rafters, that round him made
masses and moving shapes of shade,--
by the trembling ladder, steep and tall,
to the highest window in the wall,
where he paused to listen and look down
a moment on the roofs of the town,
and the moonlight flowing over all.
beneath, in the churchyard, lay the dead, 
in their night-encampment on the hill, 
wrapped in silence so deep and still 
that he could hear, like a sentinel’s tread, 
the watchful night-wind, as it went 
creeping along from tent to tent, 
and seeming to whisper, “all is well!” 
a moment only he feels the spell 
of the place and the hour, and the secret dread 
of the lonely belfry and the dead; 
for suddenly all his thoughts are bent 
on a shadowy something far away, 
where the river widens to meet the bay, --
a line of black, that bends and floats 
on the rising tide, like a bridge of boats.
meanwhile, impatient to mount and ride, 
booted and spurred, with a heavy stride, 
on the opposite shore walked paul revere.
now he patted his horse’s side, 
now gazed on the landscape far and near, 
then impetuous stamped the earth, 
and turned and tightened his saddle-girth;
but mostly he watched with eager search 
the belfry-tower of the old north church, 
as it rose above the graves on the hill, 
lonely and spectral and sombre and still.
and lo! as he looks, on the belfry’s height, 
a glimmer, and then a gleam of light!
he springs to the saddle, the bridle he turns, 
but lingers and gazes, till full on his sight 
a second lamp in the belfry burns!
a hurry of hoofs in a village-street,
a shape in the moonlight, a bulk in the dark, 
and beneath from the pebbles, in passing, a spark 
struck out by a steed that flies fearless and fleet: 
that was all! and yet, through the gloom and the light, 
the fate of a nation was riding that night; 
and the spark struck out by that steed, in his flight, 
kindled the land into flame with its heat.
he has left the village and mounted the steep,
and beneath him, tranquil and broad and deep,
is the mystic, meeting the ocean tides;
and under the alders, that skirt its edge,
now soft on the sand, now loud on the ledge,
is heard the tramp of his steed as he rides.
it was twelve by the village clock
when he crossed the bridge into medford town.
he heard the crowing of the cock, 
and the barking of the farmer’s dog, 
and felt the damp of the river-fog,
that rises when the sun goes down.
it was one by the village clock,
when he galloped into lexington. 
he saw the gilded weathercock 
swim in the moonlight as he passed, 
and the meeting-house windows, blank and bare, 
gaze at him with a spectral glare, 
as if they already stood aghast 
at the bloody work they would look upon.
it was two by the village clock,
when be came to the bridge in concord town. 
he heard the bleating of the flock, 
and the twitter of birds among the trees, 
and felt the breath of the morning breeze
blowing over the meadows brown.
and one was safe and asleep in his bed
who at the bridge would be first to fall,
who that day would be lying dead,
pierced by a british musket-ball.
you know the rest. in the books you have read,
how the british regulars fired and fled,--
how the farmers gave them ball for ball,
from behind each fence and farmyard-wall,
chasing the red-coats down the lane,
then crossing the fields to emerge again
under the trees at the turn of the road,
and only pausing to fire and load.
so through the night rode paul revere;
and so through the night went his cry of alarm
to every middlesex village and farm,-- 
a cry of defiance, and not of fear,
a voice in the darkness, a knock at the door,
and a word that shall echo forevermore!
for, borne on the night-wind of the past,
through all our history, to the last,
in the hour of darkness and peril and need,
the people will waken and listen to hear
the hurrying hoof-beats of that steed,
and the midnight message of paul revere.

just as my fingers on these keys 
make music, so the selfsame sounds 
on my spirit make a music, too. 
music is feeling, then, not sound; 
and thus it is that what i feel, 
here in this room, desiring you, 
thinking of your blue-shadowed silk, 
is music. it is like the strain 
waked in the elders by susanna: 
of a green evening, clear and warm, 
she bathed in her still garden, while 
the red-eyed elders, watching, felt 
the basses of their beings throb 
in witching chords, and their thin blood 
pulse pizzicati of hosanna. 
in the green water, clear and warm, 
susanna lay. 
she searched 
the touch of springs, 
and found 
concealed imaginings. 
she sighed, 
for so much melody. 
upon the bank, she stood 
in the cool 
of spent emotions. 
she felt, among the leaves, 
the dew 
of old devotions. 
she walked upon the grass, 
still quavering. 
the winds were like her maids, 
on timid feet, 
fetching her woven scarves, 
yet wavering. 
a breath upon her hand 
muted the night. 
she turned— 
a cymbal crashed, 
and roaring horns. 
soon, with a noise like tambourines, 
came her attendant byzantines. 
they wondered why susanna cried 
against the elders by her side; 
and as they whispered, the refrain 
was like a willow swept by rain. 
anon, their lamps' uplifted flame 
revealed susanna and her shame. 
and then, the simpering byzantines 
fled, with a noise like tambourines.
beauty is momentary in the mind— 
the fitful tracing of a portal; 
but in the flesh it is immortal. 
the body dies; the body's beauty lives. 
so evenings die, in their green going, 
a wave, interminably flowing. 
so gardens die, their meek breath scenting 
the cowl of winter, done repenting. 
so maidens die, to the auroral 
celebration of a maiden's choral. 
susanna's music touched the bawdy strings 
of those white elders; but, escaping, 
left only death's ironic scraping. 
now, in its immortality, it plays 
on the clear viol of her memory, 
and makes a constant sacrament of praise.

some say the world will end in fire,
some say in ice.
from what i’ve tasted of desire
i hold with those who favor fire.
but if it had to perish twice,
i think i know enough of hate
to say that for destruction ice
is also great
and would suffice.

whose woods these are i think i know.   
his house is in the village though;   
he will not see me stopping here   
to watch his woods fill up with snow.   
my little horse must think it queer   
to stop without a farmhouse near   
between the woods and frozen lake   
the darkest evening of the year.   
he gives his harness bells a shake   
to ask if there is some mistake.   
the only other sound’s the sweep   
of easy wind and downy flake.   
the woods are lovely, dark and deep,   
but i have promises to keep,   
and miles to go before i sleep,   
and miles to go before i sleep.

i have been one acquainted with the night.
i have walked out in rain—and back in rain.
i have outwalked the furthest city light.
i have looked down the saddest city lane.
i have passed by the watchman on his beat
and dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain.
i have stood still and stopped the sound of feet
when far away an interrupted cry
came over houses from another street,
but not to call me back or say good-bye;
and further still at an unearthly height,
one luminary clock against the sky
zroclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right. 
i have been one acquainted with the night.

two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
and sorry i could not travel both
and be one traveler, long i stood
and looked down one as far as i could
to where it bent in the undergrowth;
then took the other, as just as fair,
and having perhaps the better claim,
because it was grassy and wanted wear;
though as for that the passing there
had worn them really about the same,
and both that morning equally lay
in leaves no step had trodden black.
oh, i kept the first for another day!
yet knowing how way leads on to way,
i doubted if i should ever come back.
i shall be telling this with a sigh
somewhere ages and ages hence:
two roads diverged in a wood, and i—
i took the one less traveled by,
and that has made all the difference.

the force that through the green fuse drives the flower
drives my green age; that blasts the roots of trees
is my destroyer.
and i am dumb to tell the crooked rose
my youth is bent by the same wintry fever.
the force that drives the water through the rocks
drives my red blood; that dries the mouthing streams
turns mine to wax.
and i am dumb to mouth unto my veins
how at the mountain spring the same mouth sucks.
the hand that whirls the water in the pool
stirs the quicksand; that ropes the blowing wind
hauls my shroud sail.
and i am dumb to tell the hanging man
how of my clay is made the hangman’s lime.
the lips of time leech to the fountain head;
love drips and gathers, but the fallen blood
shall calm her sores.
and i am dumb to tell a weather’s wind
how time has ticked a heaven round the stars.
and i am dumb to tell the lover’s tomb
how at my sheet goes the same crooked worm.

what if a much of a which of a wind
gives the truth to summer’s lie;
bloodies with dizzying leaves the sun
and yanks immortal stars awry?
blow king to beggar and queen to seem
(blow friend to fiend: blow space to time)
— when skies are hanged and oceans drowned,
the single secret will still be man
what if a keen of a lean wind flays
screaming hills with sleet and snow:
strangles valleys by ropes of thing
and stifles forests in white ago?
blow hope to terror; blow seeing to blind
(blow pity to envy and soul to mind)
— whose hearts are mountains, roots are trees,
it’s they shall cry hello to the spring
what if a dawn of a doom of a dream
bites this universe in two,
peels forever out of his grave
and sprinkles nowhere with me and you?
blow soon to never and never to twice
(blow life to isn’t; blow death to was)
— all nothing’s only our hugest home;
the most who die, the more we live

somewhere i have never travelled,gladly beyond
any experience,your eyes have their silence:
in your most frail gesture are things which enclose me,
or which i cannot touch because they are too near
your slightest look easily will unclose me
though i have closed myself as fingers,
you open always petal by petal myself as spring opens
(touching skilfully,mysteriously) her first rose
or if your wish be to close me,i and
my life will shut very beautifully,suddenly,
as when the heart of this flower imagines
the snow carefully everywhere descending;
nothing which we are to perceive in this world equals
the power of your intense fragility:whose texture
compels me with the colour of its countries,
rendering death and forever with each breathing
(i do not know what it is about you that closes
and opens;only something in me understands
the voice of your eyes is deeper than all roses)
nobody,not even the rain,has such small hands

seek not the spirit, if it hide	
inexorable to thy zeal:	
trembler, do not whine and chide:	
art thou not also real?	
stoop not then to poor excuse;
turn on the accuser roundly; say,	
‘here am i, here will i abide	
forever to myself soothfast;	
go thou, sweet heaven, or at thy pleasure stay!’	
already heaven with thee its lot has cast,
for only it can absolutely deal.	

i wandered lonely as a cloud
   that floats on high o'er vales and hills,
when all at once i saw a crowd,
   a host of golden daffodils;
beside the lake, beneath the trees,
fluttering and dancing in the breeze.
continuous as the stars that shine
   and twinkle on the milky way,
they stretched in never-ending line
   along the margin of a bay:
ten thousand saw i at a glance,
tossing their heads in sprightly dance.
the waves beside them danced, but they
   out-did the sparkling waves in glee:—
a poet could not but be gay
   in such a jocund company:
i gazed—and gazed—but little thought
what wealth the shew to me had brought:
for oft when on my couch i lie
   in vacant or in pensive mood,
they flash upon that inward eye
   which is the bliss of solitude,
and then my heart with pleasure fills,
and dances with the daffodils.

when haughty expectations prostrate lie,
and grandeur crouches like a guilty thing,
oft shall the lowly weak, till nature bring
mature release, in fair society
survive, and fortune’s utmost anger try;
like these frail snow-drops that together cling,
and nod their helmets smitten by the wing
of many a furious whirlblast sweeping by.
observe the faithful flowers! if small to great
may lead the thoughts, thus struggling used to stand
the emathian phalanx, nobly obstinate;
and so the bright immortal theban band,
whom onset, fiercely urged at jove’s command,
might overwhelm, but could not separate!

 o! for my sake do you with fortune chide,
 the guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,
 that did not better for my life provide
 than public means which public manners breeds.
 thence comes it that my name receives a brand,
 and almost thence my nature is subdu'd
 to what it works in, like the dyer's hand:
 pity me, then, and wish i were renew'd;
 whilst, like a willing patient, i will drink,
 potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection;
 no bitterness that i will bitter think,
 nor double penance, to correct correction.
   pity me then, dear friend, and i assure ye,
   even that your pity is enough to cure me.

 what is your substance, whereof are you made,
 that millions of strange shadows on you tend?
 since every one, hath every one, one shade,
 and you but one, can every shadow lend.
 describe adonis, and the counterfeit
 is poorly imitated after you;
 on helen's cheek all art of beauty set,
 and you in grecian tires are painted new:
 speak of the spring, and foison of the year,
 the one doth shadow of your beauty show,
 the other as your bounty doth appear;
 and you in every blessed shape we know.
   in all external grace you have some part,
   but you like none, none you, for constant heart.
